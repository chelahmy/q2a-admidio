# [Question2Answer](http://www.question2answer.org/) Single Sign-on with [Admidio](https://www.admidio.org/)

Please read [Installing Question2Answer with single sign-on](https://docs.question2answer.org/install/single-sign-on/) before proceeding.

Question2Answer (q2a) can delegate its entire user management to a third party. Here we will delegate q2a user management to Admidio. Q2A has a [framework](https://docs.question2answer.org/install/single-sign-on/) to make it happen. This kind of framework allows an application to be semi-embedded into another application. Many small applications should be embeddable into another bigger application. It will improve multi-application user experience. A user centric application like Admidio should become a host for many embeddable applications.
