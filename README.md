Question2Answer (q2a) can delegate its entire user management to a third party. In this case we will delegate q2a user management to Admidio. Q2A has a [framework](https://docs.question2answer.org/install/single-sign-on/) to make it happen. This kind of framework allows an application to be embedded into another application. Many small applications should be embeddable into another bigger application. A user centric application like Admidio should become a host for many embeddable applications.
